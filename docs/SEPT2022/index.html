i’ve always wanted to get acknowledged for something i did, something i drew. and i think i did, in primary school, whenever they wanted someone to sketch or make arts, every one always pointed to me, vouched for me, i even went in competitions, and won! i love this moments 
then headed to secondary school, met more creative minds, some even were more than mine, but as i rub minds, i started getting bigger in the arts i make, started making comic books, i became consistent, made more comic books than study books, for that moment i was like the king of comic book in my school and everybody always wanted to see what i did
goes on and on till 2017 when  i started seeing digital arts, i really loved them and wanted to learn, but no body was there to really teach me how, all i could get from anybody i asked was just the software they used. so i watched videos, rely on my mind, did a lot of research, saved thousands of arts pictures  i could find just to get references and be like the artists i’ve seen. 
and i can say that really worked for me, i didn’t really be like the artist tho, but i became better on my own style and it’s great
joining the nft society made things much better, cos i started hearing stories like mine and saw much arts and interact with a lot of artist who turned into friends and it’s all cool.
so sad that i don’t really get the audience right now, but i think i really have to prove myself to them, and show my worth, make them acknowledge me like i’ve always did and will continue doing <br><br>i recently just joined the nft space, haven’t release a lot nfts, just 3, and none hand been collected, maybe it hasn’t reach the right person that loves it.
well my nft express what i feel, what i think. what my mind says. all the things i can’t really say in words, i pour them into arts and let them speak for themselves <br><br>i’ve been using sketchbook app since 2017, for a while i switched to adobe illustrator to try out vector arts and after all, still came back to sketchbook app. it’s really a great app. i’ve been using my phone and sketching with my fingers, never really tried using a pen(or lets just say i don’t have the resources for that yet) but it’s rally great and it’s really good, i’m making magics with my phone and fingers, magic fingers lol<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I have my own style , i don't copy anyone else's  art style so that makes me unique as a creator. How i shaped my artistic path that's a nice question. And i will just simply say that i were destined to be an artist , so i was born an artist , i am living as an artist and i will die as an artist. <br><br>My NFT name is  " Tale Of Eternal Love " that is actually inspired by the inner beauty of the person . This NFT tells beauty of face doesn't matter , beauty of soul matters .“Everything that is made beautiful and fair and lovely is made for the eye of one who sees.”  .The  "Tale of eternal love"  is basically a love story of a demon and a beautiful girl .They both fall in love with each other and the make a tale of eternal love.

 "Dear, it's the same you I fall in love - a hundred times,
In a hundred forms - endlessly from now and forever.
The more I hear the eternal tale, the eternal pain of love,
I can feel the pain as my own,
Looking back into the infinite, I can see your eternal face,
Twinkling through the eternal dark night
like the Polar star upon my heart's sky.
We two have come floating through the river of Eternal Love,
Deep within the Eternal Heart this love was born;
Now this eternal love has found its shore,
Let me put down all my love near your feet,
All the love of the universe, all its sorrow and joy-
Has lost into one single love;
It's the same love song -
sung by all poets of all ages."<br><br>I use 4 tools in this NFT :  Computer ,Adobe Illustrator , Adobe Photoshop. , Explaindio .I made it on the computer with the help of these three software , and animation were created through Photoshop and Explaindio.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

Art in general, true, but especially paintings and in particular those of Flemish masters ... However, my hand is not very good at drawing, so when I discovered the opportunities given by AI art I did not hesitate and I started experimenting! I like mixing styles and trying to produce different effects, most of the times still being guided by the aesthetic code of my favorite painters. <br><br>The maid in this NFT knows that the ballroom in this lavish palace does not belong to her, yet, when the ballroom is not ready and nobody is around, she likes to practice some dance moves and she allows herself to dream ... <br><br>This NFT is a "collage" made of two AI generated images: the background (the ballroom) and the figure (the maid). The ballroom was created with DiscoDiffusion 5.6, upscaled and retouched in GIMP to improve perspective.

I just born in it.<br><br>Once a day, my teacher in art school said; birds never think about flying, they just flies. Painting is like a bird flying. If i am ready in that particular moment, i dont think what will i create. I just choose a medium depends on my mood and start without thinking the end. Most of my pieces ends with dark themes. I used ink and watercolor for "In Nautilus". It started with a young girl. Then i put her alone in a submarine. I think my mind find a place where i can be most alone.<br><br>I used ink for line drawing and cross hatching and watercolors for painting.

I'm used to making art every day of the week. Since starting to work more on my own art since art college  I discovered I could enter the world of the characters I create in my paintings by listening to very loud music. Something I used to do when I needed to get into character when acting, using emotion memory. This process comes out very fast, afterwards I then calmly digitally paint more of the story over the image created whilst dance painting.  The beats of music then start in my head instead.  I find that every picture has a riddle in it which I have to solve, so the combination of the analogue and the digital is a joy to me to experiment with. With the digital art I can explore every single character I've made and recreate the stories for other people to read. Cartoons , films, music, stories and sculptures I've made I've recently been  combining to work together for the first time ever.  <br><br>This NFT was inspired by recurring dreams I have of female  characters emerging from deserts, walls and vast, open desolate landscapes as marble statues. They  dance in a circle and make plants grow and birds fly around them in patterns of black and white in the sky. I recreated one of the characters here, Red the warrior. Not a violent protagonist, a peaceful, strong and determined woman, like the women in my dreams and those that I admire. I painted her to remind myself also, that whatever happens to me I can handle it. To remain strong and not to allow any fear or self doubts overtake me. Red is a symbol of peace and strength to overcome difficult times. <br><br>Headphones.
Hip Hop - ODB mainly & The Shamen . Boss Drum on a loop to begin with seems to se the right atmosphere for these particular characters.
Next I use conte pencils, biros, acrylic paint, leftover computer ink & oil paint.
I like to slide the paint with stanley knife blades for a sharper edge.
Daler & Rowney oil paint is the best.
Canon left over ink cartridges. 
Take a photograph with white boards around the image and then digitally highlight areas afterwards using my Wacom One Tablet and stylus, second hand refurbished, fantastic as I am very rough with equipment. <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I come from quite an artistic family so it was in my blood from a small age. When drones came out it was love at first sight. The possibility of a totally unique view of the world from above fascinated me. Finally I saved up enough to buy my first drone and haven’t looked back. First flights were baby steps but after a trip to Iceland and a photographer who taught me how to fly and enjoy to the maximum my drone I was in heaven. The second part of my artist journey came when I began to use photoshop and found out the true potential of transforming my aerial photographs  into tiny pieces of paradise. <br><br>My lifetime dream was to travel to Hawaii. After three years of cancellations due to covid I finally made it this summer. My aerial photographs express minimalism, clean, crisp photographs with beautiful blue seas and white sands. Adding the colours of the umbrellas makes the photo fun and the two people walking along the beach with the long shadows carrying the inflatable toy adds perspective  of size and more colours to the photo . <br><br>This particular photo took me 4 hours to edit. It was taken with a mavic pro 2 at an altitude of 100 metres. At first I crop then spend quite a large amount of time cleaning up the photo. The colours are then adjusted to bring out the bright blues and the white sands I then cut out roughly the non moving elements  which I adjust colour to accordingly. After this stage I add motion blur to the background and adjust the. Olive again. Then I finely tweek the cut so the edges are perfect and the shadows are perfect. Then I add the people to the notion blurred background and do a final adjust. To the colours. <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

As a natural-born and self-taught artist, I've always been passionate about creating and communicating through different methods and mediums. Sketching, drawing, painting, dancing, writing poetry, and photography have all come naturally to me as a means of expression and introspection.
A melting-pot of international influences have also inspired my genuine admiration for diverse art forms, styles, cultures, languages, and beliefs. My creative work reflects the multitude of influences gained from a multidimensional life. I welcome you to my journey of artistic exploration and discovery. A journey through which I hope to rouse your thoughts and emotions with my expressions of art, design, and poetry.<br><br>“Sorceress” is a rich media poem that symbolizes the magical power of love and language.

I’m interested in the way different mediums can play with each other to create something captivating, just as speech and language can create magic in and of itself. That our words can be used to charm or captivate someone, to enamor them, is a mystical thing.

The still image is AI-generated with VQGAN+CLIP (via @poetry2art
) based on the poetic text itself. It illustrates yet another example of the wonders that language can create. The imagery, typography, and animated effects emote the ephemeral nature and spellbinding hold that love can have on us.

Language is love, and love is magic. It can take a hold of a lover lest it disappears just as easily as it can appear.

I have a background in graphic design and a Bachelors Degree in Photography. Nowadays I work as a Lead Creative Developer in an agency at the intersection of design and technology.

In personal history, I've had quite difficult times. I lost my dad to complications of diabetes before I actually got to know him. At the time I was 1 year old. Later, my big brother died in a car accident when I was only 12 years old. These events have had a huge impact on my life and I've suffered from various mental health issues since I was a teenager. Anxciety, depression, panic attacks, etc.

Art has always been a form of therapy for me, a way of sorting my thoughts; A way for me to express myself as I've always been more of an introvert.<br><br>The series “I’m not really here” is about trying to find beauty, safety and comfort at these terrifying times.

The waves of global bad news are overwhelming, at least to me personally. I cannot even imagine the nightmares that so many people are living in.

At times I need to focus on something else so that I’m not drawn into darkness. Try to find a safe corner in my imagination and close my eyes.<br><br>When I was studying photography back in the day, I was reluctant to take photos of people. For me it felt awkward to use someone as a prop in my work. Or to make them act the story or emotion I was trying to convey.

In this project I’ve continued to explore the use of AI generated people as 'models' and apply my own style to create the final pieces.

I start with the concept and do the “art direction”. 

For the initial raw images I use various AI tools, including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney and produce often several hundred raw images.

After curation, I use different tools for upscaling and cleaning up the raw images. Post processing, editing and manipulation is done in Photoshop.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

Producer and cultural manager. I have been working for 25 years in the cultural and entertainment area in artistic projects that move between dance, popular culture, visuals, technology and management. Director of Macarenando Dance Concept. Artistic Director of Muovere Cia de Dança. Graduated in Dance. Master and specialist in Visual Poetics. Doctorate in Performing Arts. I started my professional career in the 90s, having worked on more than 300 cultural projects. My work is recognized nationally and internationally, with numerous awards received. Artistic creation mediated by technology is not something new for me. “Pas de Corn” (2006) is the first and most emblematic work resulting from this relationship: a video that presents a corps de ballet made up of popcorn and that uses humor to satirize the dancer's body. The work received many awards, participated in several festivals and is used as a reference in research on videodance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l573mRwt_Cw). “Under the table” (2007) and “Moving in Parts” (2008/Açoriano's New Media Award) are other works created in the continuity of the research with videodance. In 2009, I received the CAPES scholarship for a master's research in Visual Poetics (PPGAV/UFRGS), supervised by Sandra Rey. “The Collector of Movements” (2011) is the work resulting from the research, which engendered concepts of movement, collection, hypertext and interaction. Currently, I dedicate myself to artistic creation based on the hybridism between dance, 3D simulation, NFTs, web3 and metaverses. In this process, a lot has been happening, and quickly. I published three collections of 3D dance pieces: “Sylphides 3.0” (2 pieces, available at Foundation, in .ETH), “What would be your last kiss?” (7 pieces, available in Objkt, in .XTZ), and "Hypnodances" (6 pieces, only 1 available yet, in Formfunction, in .SOL). I also published the piece "Crytogam" (13 editions, sold out on Objkt, in .XTZ). The work “Sylphides 3.1” (which I am submitting in this contest) has already been selected and exhibited at the following events: moveMINT NYC: The Experience; NFT Sao Paulo; Origen Videodance Festival; Movimentale Audiovisual Festival; International Meeting on Video-dance and Video-performance; Thorium Gallery District Spatial Metaverse; Sardinia Film Festival (finalist); Cuerpo Mediado Videodanza Festival; RS International Videodance Festival; Eku'e Videodance Festival; Dance & Performance Arts Gallery; Serbest International Film Festival (semi-finalist); Imajitari - International Dance Film Festival; International Screendance Festival of Chile (semi-finalist); the first 50 Latin American artist gallery in the Open Metaverse. I was selected to be part of the team of 20 artists from the “Brashill” movement, which seeks to promote Brazilian art on web3. And I have also managed a series of meetings with Brazilian artists of the performing arts in which professionals with a background in this universe are invited to report experiences and offer basic instruments on NFTs. This profusion of artistic creation with 3D technologies and NFTs has a lot to do with a vital artistic need for expression, to talk to people, to be in the world, acting, creating, publishing, criticizing, and that dance, in its most traditional, does not allow, and perhaps even castrates, either because of the necessarily physical and face-to-face elements, or because of the political-economic contingencies of always and now. For my work process, considering the entire history of operating in the art sector for many years, these possibilities have been revolutionary. Creating my own things, deciding when, where and to whom I want to sell, how much I want to charge, setting royalties, monitoring the movement of the work and continuing to receive for subsequent sales are possibilities that deconstruct and rebuild my self-image as an artist, bringing empowerment necessary in a reality where art is increasingly being pushed under the rug. In fact, these technologies have brought me closer to a goal I've been chasing for many years: “putting my dance on the Amazon shelf”. More than a commercial goal, it is, above all, the desire to popularize scenic/performatic dance, to form an audience for art and to dominate the economic processes that involve artistic making. As these new technical possibilities allow dance to be understood and operationalized as an item, as a digital object, the possibilities for placing this object on shelves, marketing and distributing it as a product also open up. This is one of the applications I've been making in these environments: using technologies to distribute and commercialize the artwork I make in different marketplaces and communities. My links: https://linktr.ee/diego.mac<br><br>Sylphides 3.1 is a videodance3D, created by mixing and hybridizing dance with 3D animation-simulation. Title numbering refers to Web 3.0, and each item in the collection receives a subsequent numbering: 3.1, etc. However, it is not just a form of organization. The number has to do, above all, with being on the Web 3.0, moving around and creating dances in it. How to dance in Web 3.0? How to dance on web3? How to choreograph in the metaverse? How to reprocess the revolution erupted by the relationship between dance and 3D simulation? As an dance artist, I seek creative answers to these questions by mixing dance and 3D , NFTs, web3 and metaverses, provoking a dialogue between classic and contemporary, and reflecting on the future of Art+Dance. When I create dances with digital materials, my whole body is involved in this process. For me there is no distinction between physical performance and digital dance. And I think it has to do with the future of metaverse relationships. The name of the collection is a direct citation to Germanic mythology, and especially to works of great importance in the dance history: “La Sylphide” (1832) and “Les Sylphides” (1909). The pieces are used as a starting point to provoke the relationships and similarities between the classic and the contemporary, and to reflect on what is yet to come in the future of Art, in general, and of Dance, in particular. New bodies, new dances? The aesthetic and artistic elements explored in the sylphs of previous centuries through airy female figures with revolutionary and abstract dances on tiptoe are now reworked based on new protocols, new codes and new paradigms provoked by Web 3.0, by sci-fi and biofuturism. Other bodies, other dances. The figure of the feminine, romantic, air genie, vaporous, enigmatic and superhuman sylph gives way to androgynous figures, neither masculine nor feminine, decentralized, with simulated physics, soft parts, procedural choreographies, disjointed movements and  articulations hyperflexibles. Hyperhumans. Several bodies. Various dances.<br><br>Sylphides 3.1 presents 200 sylphs in embryological form. Various techniques and elements of the language of dance, such as the waltz, the wheel, the control, the support point, the mobility of the joints and the relationship with gravity were submit to the techniques and elements of animation and 3D simulation, such as ragdoll bodies, soft bodies, plastic bodies, expansion and  contraction of force fields, fluids, winds, low gravity and impulsive surfaces. Thus, there is a collective ballet body, with a single pulse, but with particular focuses and dismemberments, exploring the relationship of classical ballet elements with modern and contemporary dances. The work is accompanied by an original historical recording, published in 1916, of “Les Sylphides”, by Ballets Rus Serguei Diaghilev. The software used in the creation were Blender and Adobe Premiere.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

Occasional Writer. Lover of Marmite. I am a sum of all of these things. 

I've loved art and design since an early age, coupled with a passion for science fiction and fantasy. A lot of my work bleeds over into either extreme. 

I'm a huge fan of mixed media, blending photography, digital illustration, and AI elements to create larger format pieces that have their own style and look. I'm fascinated with Web3 and technology, and how art can be coupled and engrained within it. <br><br>"Temple of Enlightenment" purposefully has multiple meanings, leaving it up to the viewer to interpret for themselves. 

On the one hand, it's about finding hope and salvation and leaving our darker woes and troubles behind us. 

On the other, it's about being wary of something "too good to be true, and digging beneath the surface to uncover the truth. Not everything is truly what it seems, and how to avoid being conned or scammed. (Something we commonly hear about in the NFT space.)<br><br>The main source images were photographs taken by myself using a Nubia Redmagic cell phone. 

The design was created by manipulating these photos, and combining with other stock images and digital illustration elements in Adobe Photoshop.  <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

In my career, since I was a child, I have always had a special affinity for all kinds of art, which has led me to experiment and try various means to express myself through time.
I started collecting and supporting other artists in 2019 and I discovered NFTs in August 2021, when I fully started working in this field, as a hobby supporting artists in the space.
In November I began to show my designs, since I had previously worked for 10 years making designs for advertising for other companies. And in December many collectors began to be interested in my art, which encouraged me to continue creating. In less than a year I have sold around 100 1/1 works, I have been chosen to exhibit in the metaverse at decentraland, I have exhibited in New York at Times Square during the Armony Show, and at NfT show europe recently, I have also been selected by Monolith Gallery to exhibit my work in future exhibitions.
All this has made me have an illusion and a huge hope in my dreams, since since I was a child my dream was to be an artist, like other members of previous generations in my family.<br><br>This work of art represents the strength of dreams and the motivation of the human being above all possible difficulties.
I firmly believe that dreams can be fulfilled, with enthusiasm, motivation and work, and that we are strongly linked to our intuitive nature, so I try to represent a woman sleeping in the middle of nature, with an expression of tranquility and well-being that represents the absolute assurance that your wishes can be fulfilled if we work for it and have a burning desire to achieve them.
My inspiration, as in other previous works, is the feminine nature linked to our intuitive nature.<br><br>I have used several artificial intelligence tools for this work, generating a lot of images of the same idea, trying to change the words in the description until I get the result more in line with what I wanted to represent, then it has been retouched and perfected as well as modified in several aspects with traditional design tools to achieve the final result, I try to curate my artwork to have a masterpiece as result.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I also have a popular YouTube channel where I share my Procreate tutorials. For my NFTs, I combine 3d visuals, 2d and Neural networks to create mesmerizing artworks. <br><br>The inspiration for the NFT comes from seeing pretty girl portraits by pretty artists. I wanted to offer another side of the story, inspiring options for female artists to be something other than a pretty face painting sexy portraits. 

This is a self portrait after entering the NFT space. I sleep on the opposite timezone and see only one hour of daylight everyday. The habit has caused insomnia and permanent swollen eyes. The only light we see are the lights that’s coming out of retina screens. This is the life of a Web 3.0 degen. <br><br>The style is inspired by the Alla Prima movement, an oil painting technique that involves completing an artwork in a single session- usually during live drawing or outdoors(plein air). In order to recreate this style, i fast tracked the production using Stable Diffusion- an AI tool. 

The output is then manipulated and overpainted in Procreate to implement the narrative, spontaneity and looseness of the genre. There is also a slight glitch effect to simulate the never ending pixels of web3. <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I was guided to other aspirations by those around me. 
    Continuously overburdened and overshadowed by the greatness of my grandfather, whom was a successful architect in life.
I stayed away from the arts as anything more than a hobby or distraction. 
  In 2019 I lost my father, and swirled into a depression, turning away from even the most important things in life. 
   But, one day, in a strangely anticlimactic fashion, I decided to start sketching out my feelings amidst all the darkness.  This drive to at least attain some normalcy brought me to the slow progression of skill. 
   Progression turned into a powerful drive. Something that wouldn't let go of me and still doesn't.
  What if I could take a simple skill, sketching and the use of Pastel and turn it into something more? What if I could push and push this until I discovered my own worth? 
  There wasn't a shadow after all. I should have been inspired by my family and by my grandfather to be what I wanted! I wanted to push my skill till I could draw whatever I wanted and use it to change the things around me. 

   And so... in this next piece you will see that continued journey.<br><br>Our universe is not completely expressible in its complexity but rather in simple forms, that we make, to bring it into our understanding.

I saw in that a lot of creative possibilities and i wanted to learn everything i could in order to always create new effects. 
After those first years making 2D i decided that i my was time to open a new door of possibilities, which is the 3D. First i was following tutorials, learning the basics, and i started to let my imagination tell the path to follow and creating what i started to call art. 
That’s how i started to create my first scenes, my first objects. With all that bag of knowledge, i was now able to think about an idea, a concept, or replicate a scene that i turned in art. 
Everything is possible, everything that i imagine is possible to create, that’s what submerged myself.

I try more and more to create my own style, adding an identity to my creations, the goal is to be able to touch people. I want to be remembered by my style, not by a name or a signature.

Nowadays, we know the importance of respecting the nature and the environment. This piece, more than the skills, is about a message. 
Let’s respect the Nature, and take care of her. She is stronger than us, she can take over us in any second. We need to let her live her life. 
This ghost represent the spiritual aspect of her protector. He is here, making sure she is safe and pushing back everything that could interfere.

I builder the set in cinema 4d, and rendered everything with octane. It’s a powerful render engine, using path tracing for the realisme. 

I also used different softwares for the details.
The ghost was simulated in Marvelous Designer, which is a cloth software.

Plants were grabbed on quixel bridge and textured inside of c4d. 

The lightning, texturing, and rendering where also made with octane. And the post process was made inside of After Effects to add a cinematic and gorgerous look !<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

at the same time and actually always i am thematically interested in the depth of every human being. 
the first and often arising impression, that it is about simple twin portraits, is wrong. rather a person meets himself in each case. in the dream, in the un-dream, in the thought, in the feeling.

currently 12 works are available, 2 of them have been collected so far.<br><br>in my work with AI, i always have the goal that the raw file from AI matches what i had as a goal.
so i am a master of "prompt" and not a photoshop plastic surgeon.

Art and creating has always been a big part of my life. I discovered that you can take your pain and turn it into something beautiful.

But I don't have much dexterity so I tied up this energy at the computer science world. I loved to make programming and later creating websites and some online illustrations what connected to my work. That was the point when I recognized what makes me happy. When I made something from something different else. The whole creating process is a kind of happiness. The happiness what I want to feel at my grey everydays. My first hobby is to make delicious dishes. 

The cooking and making illustraions are have a lot of common points. Creating from raw materials something different is a very calming and  uplifting and not least happy process. But i dont know what makes me a unique creator. I think every creator who enjoys the creating process and loves his/her work is unique. I almost forget the most important thing. The happy moments what you give to others. Because that is very good that you enjoy the creating but at least as important that who meet your art will get some positive feeling from that. Without this nothing matters. Nor the food and nor the art.
<br><br>I like to eat and like to cook and like things what have roots. So traditional dishes are the perfect choice to like. To love. To create, and hope to give some love with it to everybody. Just like foods. Every nation has a miracle in their dishes. And I want to introduce that through my NFTs.
Remember who cooks for you, that loves you!<br><br>My imaginare, first of all.  I made digital arts, so I use personal and stock photos and GIMP to photo manipulation and Canva for design. <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

They are now able to upload their creations online to share with the world in a matter of seconds because of these two tools.

I am an AIartist and explore the relationship between technology and art. I create AI-generated artworks with new technologies. My work is about exploring my identity as an artist, building community, and exploring what it means to be human in the future of web3.0.

The key moments in my life that shaped my artistic path were when I was introduced to new technologies, but when I discovered new technologies like 3D modeling software or virtual reality headsets, my passion for art grew stronger. I came to know about NFT back in 2021 but never interested, but due to pandemic Lockdown I have much time to explore web3. So I started learning from that time and now I have been creating AI artwork since February 2022 on different marketplaces. I use Google collab notebooks to generate arts and sometimes AI software, along with also editing and shaping the art using different tools available there.

<br><br>There are all sorts of different NFTs out there. The source of my inspiration for my NFTs comes from a variety of places. I express a message of spiritual awareness, I got inspired by the stories of alien abductions, and Gaia videos which covered different topics like contacting ET's, the afterlife, past lives, time travel, and reincarnation. I also used AI tools to create some of my NFTs, as I wanted to explore the potential of what these technologies could do. For some collectors, the message is everything. I use the NFTs to express more personal messages. These collectors may have experienced a life-changing event that they want to share with the world, or they may simply want to express their creativity and individuality. NFTs can be used to express a wide range of messages, from the spiritual to the political. And while some collectors may simply be drawn to the aesthetic of a particular NFT, others may be more interested in the message it conveys.
The NFT itself says something about you and and your artwork style that you're interested in, there's an NFT out there for you. So, what are you waiting for? Start collecting today!

<br><br>When it comes to creating an NFT, there are a few key tools that I simply couldn't do without. First and foremost thing is open source program created by developers to a common man and artists to create  the perfect image that I can then use to create my NFT.
But of course, it's not just about the hardware. The software I use is just as important, and I'm grateful to the developers who have created such amazing tools. In particular, I use a lot of AI to help with the process of creating my NFTs.  I want to talk about the tools and techniques I used to create my NFT. I'm so grateful to have access to such amazing technology and to be able to work with incredible AI developers. 
And finally, I couldn't do without my passion for art. This is what drives me to keep creating new and innovative NFTs. 
I'm a big believer in the power of AI and it has potential to change the world for the better. So, when I heard about the possibility of creating my own NFTs, I was excited to get started.
I began by researching the different AI tools that are available. I quickly found that there are a variety of options out there, but I ultimately decided to use Google Collab notebooks and the text-to-image tool. This was helpful because it allowed me to access my GPU and utilize its processing power, with their power and performance, I also used a variety of AI tools, including a text-to-image tool, a tool for stable diffusion, and a tool for inpainting and outpainting.
I then set about creating my NFTs. I started with a variety of images, including some personal photos and some public domain images. I used the AI tool to turn the images into text, and then I used the realesrgan tool to add color and detail.
Finally, I used the inpainting and outpainting prompt engineering techniques to add the finishing touches to my NFTs.
Throughout the process, I was amazed by the power of the AI tools that I was using. I am extremely passionate about the potential of AI, and I am grateful to the developers of these tools for making them available. I'm particularly grateful for the developers of these AI tools. They've made it possible for me to create my NFTs with a high degree of accuracy and detail. Without their hard work, my NFTs would not be nearly as impressive.
I hope you will enjoy my NFTs. I'll continue to use the latest and greatest technologies to create new and innovative NFTs. I believe that AI will change the world in profound ways, and I am excited to be a part of its development.

My personal key moments that shaped my artistic path are kinda countless: From growing up as a kid in the 80s, in a time where the cold war was part of our daily life, to the easyness of being a young gun in the 90s. A lot of my astethics come from  the growing hip hop culture in that decade. I was actively spraypainting from 1995 till today and the style of different artists, some of them real legends,. always had influence on my own creative process. Due to my own participation in that graffiti and streetart ecosystem i had the chance to meet and collaborate with hundreds of artists and all of these encounters left footprints in my own view and style. In the early 2000s i started my education in terms of classic communication design. I wanted to be able to create things that were in my mind,  which led  kinda naturally to a shift of my career and work towards the path of a 3D artist.
I feel like my creative process is a lifetime journey through different times and mediums. Another huge influence of mine is the anarchic nature of the web 3 space. I started working as a designer on multiple (mostly privacy related) projects. The actual shift to explore the possibilites of AI generated art to express myself  is in that regard the consequent step forward.<br><br>The NFT i submitted shows an female artist. The paint particles and strokes in her face shows the imprints her artistic journey had on her own personal being. There are a lot of different colors, strokes and stains. To me every stain tells a story, it's a relic of the artworks which the artist created and a cornucopia of stories all the artworks expressed. The image therefore shows how creating art transforms the artist itself into some living artwork.<br><br>Claire, the raw version, was created with Midjourney AI. The final version is the result of a long post-production process with different digital image manipulation tools.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I was able to save my family and bore a child while get ridding from the work of my life - my dream. 
     It was a long and tiring time mentally and physically we had no one and alone in different countries, traveling on bold enthusiasm, that finally we can stop and at times just pure hope carried us farther farther: blind, but surely, step by step. 
     That thread deep inside me whispered where to move. I just had to TRUST and listen. Believe I direct us in the right direction, carrying heavy easel and favorite books wherever I go…
So no, I’m not ashamed of nude, I still see the beauty of body and a rising Sun. I am religious and brave; I can take myself anywhere, and feel myself free: free of borders and limits and points of view. 
     Celeste has my spirit - she’ fierce and humble; hopeful of what changes will come- she’ll accept it, because this is the way things are: they come and go- there’s no point to hold back.
     She Gives, she’s Giving all of her Essence to Create a Star. Like the Mother Goddess giving birth to a new beginning, it’s love. ( I gave birth to my son Theo- my masterpiece) 
     Celeste is not burdened by her destiny, in fact, she’s enjoying it, she chants to new Element to Carry Love, Honor, Might and Glory for as long as it won’t get corrupted - with her mind and promises to the Universe. Glorious and Brave she still has the evil (serpent) waiting for the time and opportunity to attack, but birds of free will are guarding her, she needs to give all of herself to rise it, sweaty and exhausted but full of courage she’s not intimidated by evil; evil and good are always here to counterpart each other- it’s a harmony, balance. There, in that world of heat and nothingness - Oasis of Hope still Blooms. Spirits of Thousand souls should be Reborn in order to get the second chance to be a Universe for new planets- new beginnings. Celeste tells the story to ones who listen, while enjoying the ride, the ride to the universe, in seek of harmony and purpose🤍
     My vision makes me unique, my life led me to live by my own rules, but I’m not accepted by society. I’ve always been alone in this world. And through art I can express what I carry. I have a mission but I haven’t found it yet. I’m close feels like I can grasp it. But it slips away the moment I’m able to reach it. Recognition and support will help me open my full potential. Thank you for reading part of my soul🤍<br><br>To Goddess Mother, God the Son, 
And God the Spirit, Three in One, 
Love, honor, might, and glory be 
From age to age eternally, 
And things celestial Thee shall own, 
Creator of the Stars alone.

We all have past, it shapes us: our vision, imagination or views. Sometimes it pushes us back to live in the moments familiar and comfortable. We feel secure to be somewhere familiar: even in our heads - thinking of familiar ways we had…
    What if I’ll tell you that there’s no need to feel comfort, to be accepted by society - to co-exist and survive. What if there’re greater powerful forces in life which lead us towards greater deeds? We don’t know it, do we? 
      But for creativity, for the history- it’s all that matters: what we do and what we leave behind us. When our soul leaves our body that’s all that would matter in the end. And when it does… where do you think it’ll go; will it wait to be reborn and someone in the future will have a dejavú or a dream about real us; will it go to the Abyss spending worthless life or to another Universe to have another lesson; maybe it’ll head straight to Heavens to help as an Archangel for the good in this life? I’ll tell you the story if you’ll look for the signs carefully. 
      Our bodies are terrestrial (corrupted with time) but our souls are celestial as well as Planets or Universe. They are eternal and made of completely different material - The Fifth Element. 
My story is about Celestial bodies; where they take terrestrial shape but made of Fifth Element: they can create or destroy, protect or betray, freeze or burn. Spirits, born of myths and parallel dimensions come alive on my canvas. Born from passion and beliefs, they have a mission to change the world for us to: unite, think and have purpose. Welcome!<br><br>I close 55th fantasy romance novel (in a year), close my eyes and have dream-like dialogues in my head: books unheard of, scenarios unseen - playing sometimes on unknown languages, on pure English too(it’s not my native language). Dreams colorful and full of mystery, emotions and full of purpose that something needs to be solved and done! 
With coffee I’m thinking on the story- I make sketches on an iPad first, Procreate is perfect for that. Then I make background, and lastly I create main heroine, all the muscles, dips and turns should be perfected in days by days. As a concept artist it takes not less then a month to perfect the idea and texture. I don’t have professional painting education- just bits and pieces, so I perfect myself.

<article> <h1><a href='https://www.twitter.com/pax_art' target='_blank'>0055 -  pax_art</a></h1> <a href='https://knownorigin.io/gallery/19436000-bravery'><img src='images/pax_art.png' /></a> <br><br>My journey into NFTs began when I was frustrated in my IRL work with a demanding boss.  I decided I needed a way to vent my frustrations, and I found that creating NFTs was a way to do just that.  Even before NFTs, I had various exposure to the different arts but did not do it professionally.  I would help friends with book covers and posters using my skills in photomanipulation; I would write short stories and essays when I also needed to vent some feelings.  These were the various art forms I had been using, even though I am primarily in the field of science.  When I discovered AI and NFTs, I knew I could bring the game to a newer level.  This was when I realized that I could extend my creative limits, still work on my day job and have the opportunity to mint my pieces on a digital platform no one had ever seen yet. This is what makes my journey unique; I always use the confluence of code and aesthetics in describing myself and what I do because that, for me, is what NFTs are all about--the combination of the technical, technological, and aesthetics.  This is the most suitable time to showcase this fantastic confluence of art and technology.<br><br>This particular piece is titled bravery because of the fierce emotions on the character's face.  I also chose bold colors to highlight this to provide a striking look once someone sees the piece.  The different highlights and strokes that make up the face also flow together like a tribal tattoo or an heirloom mark that seems to show that this face is that of a warrior, someone who has earned his keep on the battlefield, someone who has faced trials and had stared them down and won.  Despite the somewhat grim background of the character, the strikingly bright colors offer a stark contrast.  In the creation of this piece, those bold colors provide the hope we all face, also shown in the way the character looks up in anticipation.  That look and the colors give a different perspective to the grim description of what the character has gone through.  The colors signify hope; they suggest a transition from the dark past to the bright future that awaits.  This is the essence of bravery.  To face tomorrow with head held high,  allowing the colors to wash away the darkness that may have been a part of the past.<br><br>This piece was created through photo editing and AI tools.  It was done by layering several different abstracts together to form a face.   The main obstacle I encountered was creating the layers without a mouse and using only a trackpad on a laptop.  This created an extra challenging layer since movements were limited to what I could do on the trackpad. Different AI-generated abstracts were used in these, and a template was used from a previous competition.  After combining the layers to create the base image, the whole thing was rendered using stable diffusion.  The new stable diffusion algorithm allows the user to input an initial image and then tweak the parameters to match the prompt or come up with an output that is either similar or very divergent from the original image. This allows the creator to have more control over the final image.  Adjusting prompts, noise values, and iterations make the final image more closer to what the creator has in mind. 
The background was added to the image when the initial face was made.  The following image was again run through the AI algorithm to create the final image.  <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I am an audiovisual communicator and digital artist who is always looking to create new realities using new media tools. Like image and video montage, elements of cinematography and finally artificial intelligence. I am very excited to be able to tell stories through art, in my case creating new surreal universes, which are very similar to what a human considers as their reality.<br><br>This collection of pieces explores various representations of the Metaverse and how it collectively creates and connects. Creating from communities, virtual spaces, games, and even new concepts related to blockchain technology.

With influences from Andy Warhol to Carl Jung, new conceptual variations are created that serve as a tribute to them and their thoughts. The use of mass iteration hints at the trading of blockchain editions that makes art more accessible to everyone. Also, visually that massive visible repetition represents a web of infinite size that connects us all and is always free to explore, like Jung's collective consciousness.<br><br>This piece was made using Stable diffussion Deforum colab 🖤. 
It was then processed through Jax Huemin diffusion 🧡 To give this a more prominent texture to the image and give it the touch of my style in which if you look carefully you can see eyes or faces watching you, representing for me the awareness and knowledge of the/my shadow. 
Finally in photoshop I made an image montage to add or remove details closer to what I need.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I know it's a big disadvantage for me, but that's just the way I am.
I couldn't say a specific moment. It has always been in my life. When I was a child I used to draw, when I was a teenager I went off the path, I took up art again after a turning point in my life. For other circumstances I moved away from art again and a few years ago after an injury, I returned to focus (not as much time as I would like) on art.<br><br>The greed of many people to get what others put out of their reach.
What inspired me for this creation, or rather, I had to make this creation. As a protest. 
Tired of seeing how many people do whatever it takes to get their goal, no matter how they do it or the consequences it may have on others and their lives. It was something I had to express and share. <br><br>A lot of words is not my thing, I apologize.

LOL! But I'll try summarize. I started my art journey back in the days before computers, I don't want to date myself, but like literally, computers didn't exist yet except at IBM or in Scifi movies. So I have a strong pencil/pen foundation. In the early days I wanted to be a penciler for Marvel or DC, but life had other plans and I ended up going into music and was fortunate to have had success as a world renown Producer/DJ, have performed in more countries than I can remember and have even had my music featured in anime (Space Dandy). However, the desire to create visual art can only be surpressed for so long, and back around 2000 I discovered anime and the desire to create became to strong to ignore. That was also the time the animation bug struck, and I began an intense regimine of learned everything I could about anime, animation, and modern techniques for creating graphics. At that same time I entered the corporate IT automotive world, and soon found myself being one of the go to guys for top graphics. After a few years in the corporate world, I decided to quit and do freelance graphics. During the freelance era was when I got really heavy into animation as one of my most consistent gigs was as a forensic animator. Fast forward a few years and the corporate automotive world came calling with an offer I couldn't refuse. After a few more years in the automotive sector, I entered the world of Defense and Space where I've remained until this day. Add into the mix, I was an early adopter of using A.I. to create artwork (I've even published a book on A.I. art; "Beautiful A.I."), published a mobile game for Android; "Diafygis", worked on various indie comic books and gaming companies, had 2 marriages, 4 kids, I'd say what makes me unique is the wide breadth of life experiences I have to draw from and incorporate into my art. In summary, I'm a Graphic Artist, Animator, and Deep House Producer with 15+ yrs creating illustrations and animations for Space, Defense, and Legal (forensic animation) industries.<br><br>There's no grand message hidden within my NFT. No. I just wanted to make something that looks cool and makes people feel good when they look it. Nothing more, nothing less. It was inspired by my visits to Japan, in particular Tokyo. Out of all the places I've been, Tokyo is by far my favorite city. It's hard to explain, but I feel a sense of belonging whenever I'm there. I'd feel such a calm feeling just hanging out in Shibuya or Akihabara, people watching while taking in the sights, sounds and smells, all the while enjoying a nice smoke (don't smoke kids, it's bad for you!) So with this particular NFT, I wanted to see if I could recreate that sensation a calm moment, no where to go, just hanging out in Tokyo enjoying a smoke.<br><br>This NFT is a 3D piece that I created using Poser and celshaded using a custom shader node process that created for use within Poser (don't want to reveal to much about the shader node. The Colnel never reveals the secret ingredients). The tetures are custom textures that I created using Photoshop and the buildings are just a kitbash of various 3D objects with custom textures. <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

During covid lock down I used to scribble faces on paper while homeschooling my children.  They then developed into the intricate digital faces I create today. 
My father who was an avid art collector was my biggest inspiration in regards to painting and art. The most important turning point for my artistic path was during Covid Lockdown.  Art is what kept me sane during the whole absurdity of what was going on around us.  It was like my daily meditation and therapy. It was an outlet to all my bottled up feelings regarding distancing, homeschooling my kids, and how our world and experiences had changed.<br><br>My digital Scribble faces explore different themes of mental strengths and weaknesses, they describe the chaos and struggle of my mind. They present an inner observation to how my mind struggles and copes with different feelings and emotions.

"Reflection" speaks of the state of your mind and how it can reflect positively or negatively on the way you lead your life and how you are as a person.<br><br>When creating my Scribble Faces, I start out by mapping the basic features of the face and then slowly start to scribble in the detail using darker shades for dark areas and lighter shades for the light areas.  Usually my color palette takes many turns during the timeframe of the artwork, depending on what colors I'm feeling at the time or what message and feeling the portrait is giving me.  I started out doing my faces on paper, and then moved on to Procreate that gave me the freedom to create at any time and place and to also zoom in on details.  My scribbles became tighter and closer, giving a more realistic effect.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

Since the dawn of a mankind art helped to overcome difficulties and entertained us. Now we are in the new era, new spin of evolution has come. With the help of digital technologies art really broke all the boundaries and now is available for everyone with internet connection. And am so happy to be the part of it.
Can't really say that I'm an artist from the childhood. But I've felt this magnificent experience of creating in my late teenage years. Not as a 3d artist but as a photographer. So I've decided to connect my life with this. Several years in the university, years of practice and now I'm the director of photography on the leading TV channel.
Now it's a new phase. I'm an introvert by nature  and sometimes it's difficult for me to organise big group of people and filming equipment to embody my ideas. So why don't use 3d instead? That was my question and I found an answer. Cinema 4D software. Diving deep into this tool I'm in the whole new universe with no limits at all. But of course there is one limit- my skills. I've been studying this software for more than a year. Of course I can't create complex structures or different worlds for now. But I can entertain you with loop animations! 
I really like this feeling when 5-10 sec. animation can be looped for ever. It's totally hypnotizing. And I want to share this hypnosis. Infinite loop animations are carefully resigned and rendered for you.
Relax and watch.<br><br>The main goal of my art is to make you hypnotized. I really like when my followers say- I was staring at this for like half an hour! This is the best appreciation for me.
Watch my infinite loop animations, relax and enjoy!<br><br>Everything is simple. Cinema 4D software and Octane render. And my imagination of course :)<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I'm Diana, & I'm from India. I've been studying and working with a variety of energy modalities for around 8 years now. I love engaging with crystals, psychedelics, sacred geometry, the chakric system & astrology to name a few. I've been trained in the ancient Indian system of 'Varmakalai', which works on the basis of vital energy points in the body, as well as Ayurvedic bodywork therapies.
I practised natural building before joining the NFT space, creating structures made out of natural materials like cob, stone and bamboo. Realised at one point I could incorporate sacred geometry into these structures (it is the basis of all life!), and that was a complete turning point in my life in general.Everything just 'fit' better. 
What fascinates me the most though, is finding the underlying (and overarching?) connection in everything around me (and in myself), which is how my genesis project came to be. <br><br>Each grid in this collection has a certain intention behind it, they're all explained in detail alongside each NFT. 
The one I've submitted is titled 'Heartfelt', and the main inspiration is always my own journey, and the lessons I've learned, and continue to learn. 

Description - 

"Harder times require extra loving.”

Learning to live from the centre of your heart is exactly what this grid is designed to help with. Often times we find ourselves in situations and places in our lives that require us to have our defences up, to be aggressive, to be hard, and honestly that’s just life. But we just as often to forget to bring them back down.

Most often though, we find ourselves oscillating between the two extremes. The calm and soothing energies of the crystals used in this particular grid will remind you to soften the edges that inevitably get too hard and will teach you to live from a space of love, while also maintaining healthy boundaries.

The crystals are aligned with the sacred geometric pattern of Metatron’s Cube - its energy helps in understanding and internalising the balance and harmony of nature, and also serves as a guide for personal transformation. The integrated energies of the crystals and the sacred geometry will essentially aid you in balancing the energies of your heart chakra, hence allowing you to live more in harmony with yourself and your surroundings.
<br><br>I've always approached sacred geometry in its traditional form, so the tools I use to create are my trusty compass and straight edge. I don't use any measuring tools in this process. This usually makes it take a long longer to create each geometric form, because even the more complex ones are derived from the basic form of the Vesica Piscis (two overlapping circles with equal radius). 
Usually starts with a pencil tracing, and once I know I've got it right I trace that with a pen, or paint- depending on the particular grid I'm working on. 

The crystals are then laid on top of each grid. Each crystal has its own unique  vibration and frequency, so the crystals are selected based on the intention and energy flow I want to convey through each grid. 

And then I take a photo using my phone camera and a makeshift lightbox my partner created for me. That's it ! <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

No one knows how the people in rural areas live their life because of the scarcity of journalists and photographers in small areas. In 2013, when I started my photography journey I started with clicking portraits because it not only shows the story but a deep connection with them which gives me lessons in my life always. I choose photography because it's a privileged moment for me to photograph them, and their real character with life connections. In some village areas in the world where people don't get hospital facilities where no one is there to listen to their pains, problems, or how they going through their obstacles, that's the reason why I take portraits in the streets, these factors are my key moments in my life that shaped my artistic path.<br><br>Sadness, happiness, pain and problems are written on every page of life. And reading the pan of life in the picture is also an art. I want to share about these people of the world in my work for whom we get grains, we do not die of hunger, despite, good facilities not being provided to their house. The emotions of them are expressing their character filled with happiness, sadness, pain and problems.
My work also shows the deep connection of my soul because in my work it shows my passion, and my patience for my work, my situations, and my emotions, with those people I get inspired because I get to know from them how life is and how to live in such situations. Being sadness, pain, and problems, yet I see them as happiness from the core. <br><br><br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I'm vaarin & here creating & experimenting everyday. Want to continues this journey, made more arts but don't have equipment & resource but I'm doing my best! I'm creating from childhood and continue creating, by profession, I'm graphic designer & video producer but due to covid, its finish but I won't stop creating and found nfts and then again start creating but due to issue of funds, I can't give my best and this is a major reason sometimes for me, I demotivate and don't focus on creating but I trying my best and one day this problem also solve soon! 

I create lot of thing because I love creating, like photography, motion graphic, painting, minimalist, gif stories, character design & lot more, want to try create more but due to fund its not happen! I don't want to master in one thing, I want to enjoy everything, no matter how much I get, less or more. just want to create everything because that I love but If we talk about what I want to continue so I can go with minimalist art and my gif stories (wip).

First time I discuss my this story on internet, I don't know what to type here so I put this here...<br><br>I never add description for my art because I always I said "sometimes less is more" but here showing me add more than 500 word for better ranking so I'm explaining below. 

SO I submit my "Miami View" this is my latest work so if you see this on a big screen or on a big print with white background and just starring for 5-10 min, so you'll know and  if I add my description there so you saw my art like my description & I know few saw differently but most of saw like that as I discuss above but I don't add desc. because you have your perspective means in this world everyone have different perspective and I don't want to convey my story or my perspective though art, I want people make own story with my art, I want people see my art with own vision not mine. 

SO If you ask to me what I saw in this piece so I say, I saw peace in the ocean, sky happy more than ever with full of blueish color and far way on yacht someone enjoy this moment with their frens & family and left side pattern show - path to the top, half frame of this moment and someone hotel rooms on ocean side so yaaa this is mine, I want to know about yours.

I want to create art but give chance to everyone to create their story through my art.<br><br>So I create my this art with adobe photoshop but my laptop don't powerful for this tool, even If I save something lack of system requirement I don't able to get wht I want sometimes, I need to close everything and then try restart & try again & again sometime but sometimes it won't problem because sometime file not big, like this one and sometime I have, like I recently drop "deli store" and this is big file so I have face some issue but generate finally. 

I like adobe product for digital making and I know about ps, ai, ae, pr & lrc and more...want to create so much tool but can;t make due to lack of resource but overall I like these tools for my digital making! 

Sry I don't know to wht to write and also english not 1st language so I hope you'll understand and I don't know why I'm adding my these story but I say don't have other and don't know wht to write atm. thanks! <br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I changed direction to study art/photography.    i was offered an art teacher position when it was learned that  i used to go out in the courtyard of my apt bldg to paint w the latchkey kids in the hood. Later i opened a small teaching studio of my own.  As an art teacher in a private studio i learned that i connected w victims w  special needs, elderly, folks w anxiety.  After 15 plus yrs, & taking pysch classes,  i closed my teaching studio to focus on private, one on one lessons.   Now i have more time to create some of the ideas and visions that are continually swirling in my head, i also have more freedom to help folks find a little peace in their soul , or in their minds via art.   I love what i do to help folks though i would always like more days off to create.  Lol. <br><br>I only recently learned about nfts thru a friend.  I have so many visions in my head, & can work in several mediums,  yet i continuously return to painting women, probably because i am one.  There is a sublime challenge, ive found, in painting a portrait, figure, or flower. All those tiny nuances can make or break a painting.   Da vinci is certainly my idol<br><br>I use many tools to create.
3 yrs of photography classes means i always have a camera in my hands . Either my nikon or my phone cam.  After taking a photo i will typically play w it in one or more of the various art apps or ibis paint.  After playing and manipulating i will often paint the image.

For me, besides my work, it was an instrument to relax and to forget my anger and the annoyance of everyday life. Art has always helped me to calm down and find myself. Now in 2021 I started to deal with NFT. I didn't understand anything and everything was new but I love working with IT and so I started my way to become an AI artist. I find it a miracle how I can create a picture from my words and thoughts. To express my feelings and to be able to bring this art closer to a wide audience. It's a new life path that I've started thanks to NFT<br><br>Mother Nature creates little miracles every day. Flowers are one of them. Flowers are an expression of joy or sadness, farewell or reunion.
For this piece I was inspired by the water lily. We have these beautiful flowers on our lake by our house. Every year their blossoming tempts me anew. Since I have more time for myself, I experience nature much more intensively and see things like the water lily much more clearly. I can enjoy her. I see how the leaves form, then slowly the bud comes, later the flower starts to sprout and finally everything disappears back into the lake and wakes up again the following year.<br><br>It start with a image in my head or a wish I have. First, I start to think about words that would best represent my image, to create prompts. Then I try these prompts in Midjourney or stable diffusion. Here it was Midjourney. Then the prompt is refined and sanded until I like the result and I'm satisfied with it. This can take a few days because I always want to improve or adjust the image. When I'm satisfied, I try to get the best out of the piece with Tencent and Photopea. For example make it finer, less grainy or make the colors more intense with Photopea or try a filter. These are my steps used in this piece. I did upscale right here in Midjourney with maximum Upscale. I use my Acer Laptop to create my art.<br><br><p></p></article><hr><hr><br><br>

I’m living a beautiful life in spite of all problems, I think my creations would not be what they are if didn’t live those lessons.
