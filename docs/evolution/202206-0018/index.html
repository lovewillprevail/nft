									I made Generative art with Stories - Based on Real Events!
									<p>
With literary inspiration from Freud and Jacobo Gringberg to capture in my works his approaches to the subconscious and the quantum syntergic world.
									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									<p>• I was born in, Venezuela, 34 years old, with a Master's Degree in Management and other careers at the end of fourth level university, currently speaking three languages: Spanish, English and Mandarin Chinese.</p>
								<p>

• From a young age I took art as means of escape and therapy to express and show my emotions, developing myself in a self-taught way in the artistic area. 
								<p>

• Person active in the Crypto world since 2017, and in the NFT world since December 2021. 
								<p>

• I have been verified on Rarible, which was my first Marketplace, then I opened my horizons to Opensea, after a few months when I evolved my digital art technique. 
								<p>

• I applied in Foundation making "The Cromwell's Seal Collection" with a Genesis sale in 2 hours after its minting, and later another sale 4 days later, placing me that week in the top 100 of that Marketplace.
								<p>

• I was accepted in June in Markersplace, with genesis offers within 72 hours of minting, and being top popular in said marketplace, which is a great honor for me, since my goal is to position myself within the community as a serious artist.	
								<p>
									<h3>What's next</h3>
									Having the support and acceptance of the community, collectors and markets is very satisfying and I am deeply grateful.
I will continue to develop my skills with my characteristic oriental touch, I want to bring animation to my works.
