									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									<p>1) Taking photos from young I always took photos while on family trips, on my parents old phones they were never good but I had so much fun.</p>
<p>
2) I had a Nintendo dsi and and an iPod touch that I would take everywhere to take photos for no reason other than my curiosity.

<p>
3) My uncle has been a hobbyist photographer for over 20 years and loved that I had an interest in taking photos he would give me tips and always show me his amazing photos that I never thought I could get close to taking.

<p>
4) I stopped taking photos for a long time because I never thought I was good at it and because I was so young (around 13 at the time) there was always more important things for me to be learning.

<p>
5) I asked for a camera for my birthday and my amazing parents gave me a Nikon coolpix, my first proper camera, it was a bridge camera and I didnâ€™t use it very often because of its limitations this would be what taught me most of the ground rules of photography and I would use this until 2020

<p>
6) I was lost in life finishing school depressed and empty, I didnâ€™t have any goals and I didnâ€™t know what I wanted from life, everyone around me had already decided what they were going to do next and how they would do it, so I went back to my roots, I bought a Nikon d5600 this became my outlet. Going out to different places was my escape and clicking the shutter button would become my release.

<p>
7) I canâ€™t live without photography and I canâ€™t see a future without it, Iâ€™m always trying to better my craft, trying new techniques and learning from the best before my time, photography saved me. I always think what if it didnâ€™t click for me and I can never think of a real answer, this is what pushes me to make the best art I can through photography conveying my own emotions through the work.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
									The next big stage in my evolution? Iâ€™m not even sure, I want to master every genre of photography but I donâ€™t know where that starts and where this stage ends.
