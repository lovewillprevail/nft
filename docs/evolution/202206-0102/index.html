									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
I was born and raised in a cultural family, my father was a teacher and at the same time he did artistic work. He did calligraphy and painting on glass and paper, and at the same time, he took pictures with analog cameras in the remote cities and villages where he was a teacher, and did social documentary photography.

<p>
For this reason, I was familiar with artistic spaces since I was a child, be it calligraphy, painting or photography.
<p>
First, I started with calligraphy and at the age of 11, I won the first place in the provincial calligraphy competition. But Khushi was not a space that I was 100% interested in.
<p>
Little by little I fell in love with photography. I always looked carefully at my father's negatives and was fascinated by them. This is when my father gave me a camera and bought me a very basic digital camera at the age of 15.
<p>
I have been shooting with it for years and at the same time studying and reading various art and photography books.
<p>
And I practiced photography every chance I got.
<p>
Due to the conditions and climate in which I lived, I became very interested in landscape photography and social documentary photography, and I took pictures of these two genres most of the time.
<p>
Also, I graduated in the field of Computer Science in 2017.
<p>
In 2005, while studying, I founded a computer company where we did IT and web work.
<p>
But due to US sanctions against our country, we had to close this company in 2014.
And I focused more on photography, I went on different trips with the money I had and during 10 years I photographed landscapes and social documentaries from the deserts of Iran and special regions of Iran.
<p>
I have traveled to 70% of Iran's deserts and collected a collection of Iran's deserts that is being completed.
<p>
At the same time, I became a teacher and taught photography courses in university and high school.
<p>
I participated in various photography festivals and was honored to receive medals and diplomas in several international photography festivals.
international festival: England, Serbia, France, Turkey, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, India, China, America.
<p>
I am also a permanent member and judge of the International Federation of Photography (FIAP) since 2017.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
<p>
So far, I have organized individual festivals inside the country and several group festivals abroad.
<p>
My goal in photography is to portray my feelings and poems. My photos are my inner poems that were never written but depicted.
