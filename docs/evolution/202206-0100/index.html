									<h3>Who am I?</h3>
									Hi! I am Tobias J. Gonzalez, a multidisciplinary artist and I am part of the artistic duo Inmateria Travelers.
									<p>
									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									<p>From a very young age, I always had a lot of interest in art and all forms of expression that made me feel different. Not seeing the colors "right" (I'm colorblind) and receiving criticism on several occasions telling me that what I was painting was wrong, I began to hold back. Added to this, I grew up in a very loving family but with little notion of emotions, different problems in adolescence and going to a Catholic school, I end up despairing of an autoimmune disease. My body was expressing everything that I couldn't express.</p>
<p>
And that's how I developed quite a shy and repressed personality for many, many years. I dedicated myself to admiring and appreciating art, but never being the creative part of it for fear of being judged and being exposed expressing my emotions. I lived my life halfway, I did things under pressure from other people, from family and society, I didn't encourage myself to be who I wanted to be.</p>

<p>
But the light was made about 4 years ago, and many changes began to occur in my life. After a deep meditation, where I reached alternate states of consciousness, I was able to see and feel beyond what I had ever imagined. I felt such a deep connection with everything, literally the whole universe was connected, and it showed me the wonders of life, the magic that unites us all. It also showed me the darkest shadows, my greatest fears and impediments. From that moment, everything changed. I realized that in order to live the life I dreamed of, I had to act right now, following my heart.

<p>
And it was then that I met Sol, my life partner and a fundamental pillar in my artistic and personal development. When we first heard about NFTs in February 2021, together we formed Inmateria Travelers. Combining his experience in the visual arts and my experience in computing, we began to create works together in which we conveyed our passion for magic, alternate realities and the beauty of the universe.

<p>
It was then that I decided to learn Photoshop and after effects for the first time in my life. I began to play with ideas that I had in my head, to transmit things that I felt, that were kept deep inside me and that I could only express through art.

<p>
My artistic style changes over time, but today what characterizes it the most is the path towards the expansion of consciousness, of searching beyond what is seen with the naked eye, of what is normally accepted, of transcending the limits that we often feel are imposed on us, to go where we can find the best version of what we want to be. The search for the essence of things, what makes a sensation unique and beautiful, and produces a transcendent change in the lives of other people.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
									<p>I always characterized myself as a very ambitious person, for dreaming big and for believing that all dreams are possible.
									<p>As a first goal, I want to continue improving my visual and artistic skills, to reach a level of work so impressive that it shakes the soul and heart of even the stiffest person.
									<p>
As a second thing, I would like to incorporate photography and my own music into the productions. I am currently studying and improving to reach a level that is up to the standards of the work I do.

									<p>
Another thing I would like to learn is 3D and rendering. I think the possibilities with this tool are endless!
									<p>

I would also like to be able to work with hundreds or thousands of artists from all over the world, combining our skills and visions to be able to create incredible works and projects.
									<p>

And finally, I would like this project to reach transcendental levels, to transform the lives of people, communities and nature. Contribute what I can to elevate the whole life and universe.
