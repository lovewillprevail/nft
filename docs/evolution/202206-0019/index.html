									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									Hi everyone, my name is Dasha, and I'm 21 years old, I joined the NFT community in early 2022, and I want to tell you a little about myself.

I have liked drawing since high school. Especially I remember the lessons of "fine art" in grade 4, I liked drawing watercolor and crayons very much.

Already in 7 class, I decided to study additionally in art school. I studied for 2 years. Learned to draw from life and modeling.

Until the end of school I liked to follow the artistic development of some of my friends, their art put me in shock. "How can THIS be painted?" Some drew quickly and got a masterpiece, while I drew for a long time, often going into minutiae that were insignificant against the general background.

I didn't draw anything more than scribbles on paper during a boring class until my third year in college.

At the end of the third and all the fourth year, I drew simple A3 watercolor paintings in the evenings. By the end of college, I had created six paintings, which now decorate my room. I madly liked to take the time to do it, drawing was very relaxing and calmed me down.

Six months after I finished college, I decided to try painting on my phone. It was difficult, and the result was ridiculous. But it was a good experience, because it encouraged me to buy a Samsung, even though it was used, as my finances were limited.

After half a year I have made many steps to improve my art and the main thing is a feeling of satisfaction and positive emotions that arise during and after the creation of work, the feeling that you can if not all, then much, the desire to move forward, to new achievements, pride and joy for yourself. I am happy to experience such a range of feelings, to learn how to draw and to feel like a real artist!

<p>


									<h3>What's next</h3>
My next steps in art are studying animation, 3D graphics and artificial intelligence. I admire the work of my colleagues and want to follow them.

Thank you so much for reading my story!
