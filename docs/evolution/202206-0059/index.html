									<p>I call myself Quirky as a subtle hint to folk that I ain't gonna pretend to be normal ALL the time!  Fun, to me, is the most important thing.</p>
									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
It started when an art teacher let me just get on with my own thing rather than following the lesson for the day. 8-year-old me had no idea why, but wasn't about to pass up a good thing! The doodles commenced!
<p>
Next, and some years later, I was obsessively coding mind-expanding psychedelic art because I didn't have anything else good enough to stare at.

<p>
I believe there is such a thing as a mindgasm. I would describe it as the moment when an animation or other impression has bamboozled the senses sufficiently that an undefined but definite learning event takes place. Not unlike from a koan in Zen. The mind is so confused or amazed by what it sees, it simply has to open wider to try to encompass the new experience. In the case of psychedelic animation, this might be accompanied by a pulsed rush of pleasure akin to an actual orgasm.

<p>
At first, I was using early 8-bit technology to achieve simple yet effective strobing and colour-cycling effects.
Then, as the technology and I advanced, I developed a more subtle approach with evolving shapes, gradient mixing and self directing light shows.
<p>

And my coding and art sent me on a fantastic journey. I've worked for big names like Aardman Animations, BBC and Disney. Now I'm into NFTs in a big way!
These days i mostly forge effects in my own engine-within-an-engine : Psychedelia Smith, written in Unity.
<p>

I've always had an unconventional approach to most things - call it stubbornness and a touch of autism. I generally don't use effects I didn't at least partially write. The results feel so much more personal - so much more unique.

<p>
Taste-wise, I'm really an aestheticist these days, thank you Aardman! I do love an eye-opening statement, but it's got to look good too! There's a lot of fun to be had with a simple strobe, but is it beautiful? Does it have grace and splendour? Does it, when you get right down to it, ooze quality?
<p>


									<h3>What's next</h3>
									What's my next big change or development? Well actually, I'm thinking of incorporating my 8-year-old doodle style into the mix - bring some extra flavour, another dimension. Got some fun ideas for that if i ever get a moment</p>

									<h3>Why am I member of the Jury for INFTC in July 2022?</h3>

How can you quantify art? Well you can't, but maybe you can show appreciation, spread the love and make new friends.
I'm honoured to be asked to join the fun - what an opportunity!
