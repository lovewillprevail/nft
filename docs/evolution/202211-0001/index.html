									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
I would describe myself as a creative. I have a background in graphic design and a Bachelors Degree in Photography. Nowadays I work as a Lead Creative Developer in an agency at the intersection of design and technology.
<p>
In personal history, I've had quite difficult times. I lost my dad to complications of diabetes before I actually got to know him. At the time I was 1 year old. Later, my big brother died in a car accident when I was only 12 years old. These events obviously have had a huge impact on my life.

<p>
Art has always been a form of therapy for me, a way of sorting my thoughts; A way for me to express myself as I've always been more of an introvert.

<p>
Some background for my projects:<br>
<p>

When I was studying photography back in the day, I was reluctant to take photos of people. For me it felt awkward to use someone as a prop in my work. Or to make them act the story or emotion I was trying to convey.
<p>
In my NFT projects so far I’ve explored the use of AI generated people as 'models' and apply my own style to create the final pieces.
<p>
I start with the concept and do the art direction. I use various AI tools, including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney for initial raw imagery and produce often several hundred raw images.
<p>
After curation, I use different tools for upscaling and cleaning up the raw images. Post processing, editing and manipulation is done in Photoshop.

									<h3>What's next</h3>

									As a creative, I wouldn’t categorize myself to be an AI artist. I use the tools that I feel can help me convey the message.

I could see that in the future I’ll be utilizing generative art, AI, photography or a mix of techniques in my works.
