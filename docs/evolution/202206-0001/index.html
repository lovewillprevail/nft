									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									It all began when I was young as I had an infatuation with reading and fantasy. I read dozens of books in a period of a few weeks and the local library became my home. I began picturing worlds in my head and it was as if I had lived there all my life. I started reading more, and as a result, I began writing as well. I always felt lacking because I wanted to visually show others the ideas in my head. It all came into the light a few years ago as I taught myself how to draw late at night at work. I began obsessed with doodling and sketching and it made me happy. Recently, I discovered AI notebooks and I was instantly in love. I combined my sketches with AI and I created pure randomness and surreal pieces of art. I was hooked! Now whatever comes into my head, is now put on paper. Drawn by hand and refined by AI. I wish to share my passion with the world and let others see my imagination firsthand.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
									My next big state of evolution is to become better at portraits and drawing human figures. It's my weakness, but I want to learn how. I have lore and landscapes to show worlds that I created, but I was never able to draw what the inhabitants looked like. My next big step is to learn how to create life!
