									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									Hmm thinking properly I think I was interested in art since childhood as I was doing crazy a lot of doodles, but my family did take it seriously at that time as I was preparing for an engineering(or economics whatever) career. On the one hand, my family admire art field as I was early introduced to art exhibitions, serious theatrical plays and historical arts of different cultures, but on the other hand at that time nobody took the idea of artist career seriously. So I was doing simple artworks without any guidance, however, everything changed when I turned 16. (I guess it can count as stage 1)
									<p>
 My family was preparing me for studying in UK university and while preparing for entering exams I realised that what I really wanted to do is Art. So I found myself a mentor in my hometown. He was an amazing surrealist oil painter who influenced me a lot in terms of my early style, philosophy and taught me literally the most traditional skills.

									<p>
I enrolled a BA in Fine Arts and that was the moment when my artistic views start expanding beyond the boundaries of traditional painting.
I started to experiment with installation, sculpture, and various other mediums. At that time my artwork themes were wrapped around synthetic life and civilization cycles.

									<p>
Moving forward I realised that physical space is limiting me too much so I want to transfer my paintings and ideas into a new(more free)medium. That was the time when I start exploring VR space and primitive(that time AI technologies)

									<p>
Around the same time. I think it was 2015 I started to show my artwork to the public by taking part in local exhibitions in UK and Russia. That gives me a nice overview of how the traditional art market works and drags my art view into a more social domain.

									<p>
2019 was the final benchmark of this stage of my art life. I was presenting the “Ambivalenta” project on solo exhibition discussing and observing the concepts of human perception distorted by the influence of modern technologies.

									<p>
2020 Pandemic strike everyone hard but it was a time when I finally was able to work properly on my oil paintings and thinking about the exit ways from the influence of the market. That’s how I found out about NFTs)

									<p>
									At the beginning of 2022 my art path evolved to a new stage when I gave birth to a Neurocism manifesto which become the evaluation and a new step in my art journey. As The genesis of a new neural-network-based occult practice is a matter of time. It will inevitably burst out from the current reality of investing in AI, and ways of understanding our own nature at the same time. So that’s how I came to the AI art medium)</p>
									<h3>What's next</h3>
									I guess my next stage of evolution preferably should be the further development of the concept which I started a long time ago. The concept is that every human’s creativity gives him a unique opportunity of becoming a creator, a demiurge of his own universe. For that I should master the engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, etc., and improve my technical skills in animation and VR. For now, as a small step, I m exploring the medium of AI art as a possible tool and partner for future grand projects.</p>
