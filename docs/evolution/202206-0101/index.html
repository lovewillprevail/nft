										<h2>FrederickSchultz.tez</h2>
										<br>
										<p>
										As a young kid I started with photography I got into  infrared photography. Later I did a lot of low light and night photography.

I studied art when I was a school, my father was a an art teacher I did painting and clay work. Later in life I did some painting lessons I painted abstract art.

When I started NFTs, I taught myself digital art I was doing kaleidoscopes and mandalas and now I'm doing abstract art.
<p>I'm developing my wave art.

<p>Why I do Sunset Waves : I find it relaxing looking at a wave and a sunset. 
<p>
My art has powerful elements. Water is powerful it is constantly eroding land. it is essential for us to live. Sun brings us energy and growth. Without these two elements there would be no life.
<p>
Throughout history, water has been used as a symbol of wisdom, power, grace, and the undifferentiated chaos that gave rise to the material world.
<p>
The waves represent the mighty ocean's restlessness. It also represents faith, hope, and joy even in the deepest of troubles.
<p>
Sunset symbolism indicates the completion of a cycle and an end of the day, time to relax. Or do you see sunrise, symbol of new days energy.
<p>
The sun is an emblem of glory and brilliance. It is also a symbol of authority. It represents happiness, life and spirituality.
<p>
Ocean/beach is often seen as a place for fun, reflection and escape. You head down to the beach to clear your head, and sit to reflect.
<p>
I love watching the sea waves bring life to the calm ocean.
<p>
Enjoy my art and reflect as you look at it.
