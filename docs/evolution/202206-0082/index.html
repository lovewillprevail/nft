									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
<p>
My love for art started in childhood, on the walls of my parents' house. In order to somehow distract me from painting on the walls, my family started instilling in me a love for painting Pysanky (traditional Ukrainian Easter eggs). Over time, I started to enjoy drawing human portraits, especially human eyes. Then my attention was drawn to the art of photography and architecture.

<p>
With my entrance on NFTs, I have been studying digital arts and new tools, and starting from abstract arts to 3D arts styles. I have been working with different art styles, tools, and exploring the magic of digital arts since I joined NFTs. Currently, my interests are on AI generative arts and their different tools. I believe that people should always keep up with the times and not discard or be afraid of new technologies. AI is a great way to improve existing art, as well as an opportunity for people to express themselves (by words and other means) even if they may not be a skilled painter yet. AI tools help in decentralizing artistic creation.

<p>
I am also working hard to create an NFT Community that is friendly, supportive and helpful. I regularly share knowledge in my tweets that will be useful to aspiring artists in the NFT world.

<p>
People who follow my twitter also have a great opportunity to participate in various buying NFT parties where I regularly invite the coolest NFT collectors in the space to join the party and make the maximum number of artists happy.

<p>
My goal is to support artists on their journey of recognition in the NFT space.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
Next phase: to continue to develop myself, my skills and my amazing community. Always to continue to learn something new and share my knowledge. Grow and help others to grow. Because together we are strong and to move further, we need to move together, not alone.
