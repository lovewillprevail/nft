									<p>Since I was a kid, I had this passion for drawing things. I received my first ever award for drawing a butterfly in kindergarten and was able to get into a local newspaper. I only remember flashes of that time as I was so young, but my relatives tells me about it all the time. And this always reminds me that I am also born with something, which is a part of me</p>
									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									Okay, this one is tough to explain ^^
As I come from a small city of India, nobody here took art seriously, that includes me too.
<p>
They said, it can only be taken as a hobby, so I just used to draw whenever I felt like and never tried to learn. But as the time passed, I went to high school. Now, for studies I started living in my university away from home. This was the first time for me to live that far away from my family, and coincidentally I chose Arts as an extra subject. It was the only time when I get to learn Art from great artists! Still, I didn’t take it seriously, as I thought I won’t be drawing once I pass high-school.

<p>
Many of u may not know that there’s “Senior secondary school” between high school and college in India. These two years of time, I have rarely drawn anything.
<p>

In the second last year, when I was about to go to college. IDK why I felt like drawing again, sketching mostly as I hate to rub off the colours of my hands.
<p>

Then covid happened, and we all were stuck in our homes, this was when I come to know about digital art was a real thing! I bought a tablet, and started drawing day & night.
<p>

Since then, I rarely skipped a day when I don’t draw. I got my passion back! I was so crazy about learning everything I missed, I still am. YouTube tutorials were most helpful for me all this time, and now here I am!
<p>

Sold 3 artworks as NFTs to great collectors, one of them is a great artist. Became a part of this wonderful community. Got selected for second round of INFTC, and there is still more to come!
<p>


									<h3>What's next</h3>
									Next, I am going to keep making NFTs. I want to become a great artist like every one else here in this community and I want to prove that my art can also do wonders, and it’s not just a hobby, but it’s a passion!
