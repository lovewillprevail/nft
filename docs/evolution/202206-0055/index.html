									<p>I have been into arts since my childhood. As a kid I really loved to do sketching, making landscapes and scenic views by seeing references probably that was root for me being in the arts and making environments in 3D as of now !</p>

									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									If I had to explain this in 7 stages than it would be like this!
									<p>
									1) As a kid in about 3rd standard, I loved to paint using water colours but couldn't get my hands on them so easily, this made me move into sketching!<br><p>
									<p>
2) So I started doing sketching afterwards, which involves hatching, different sketching techniques etc.. I used to make real life object's using sketching ( which doesn't look so real tho ðŸ˜‚)
									<p>
3) When I got to know about hatching (by the way it's a technique in drawing) I tried doing it with pen, this was the time I was doing traditional art for the last time.
									<p>
4) In 8th standard, our school arranged a workshop on photoshop which I eagerly joined and tried a bunch of stuff by myself! By that time I started doing photoshop but didn't know much stuff!
									<p>
5) In April 2021, when lockdown started I thought of getting my hands back on photoshop this time though I tried learning more advanced stuff online! And since I started making some art I thought why not post somewhere and let the world see whatever I make , so after few days of practice I opened my Instagram art account.
									<p>
6) I did this till like October or so but after that I started to feel an incoming art block . To overcome this I tried using different software and at the end thought to learn 3D for a change, which I wouldn't imagine will turn out so amazingly well !
									<p>
7) When I used to do photoshop I wasn't that much consistent , but when starting a new journey in 3D I thought to do it consistently and since than I'm here doing 3D , posting artwork every Sunday at about 6pm (IST) !
									<h3>What's next</h3>
									<p>My next big thing will be ; I already make 3D but I really wanna enter into animations of my 3D Artworks and not just animation, I want to make them super detailed and master lighting and composition! This is my only goal as of now !</p>
