									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
 While growing up, the story of my grandfather was a huge backdrop in my life. He was an architect, born in Louisiana, raised by his French mother. He moved after meeting his wife to California just before my mother was born.
 <p>
   The giant which was my grandfather shown in his aptitude for music and for design. The music saved him from the Korean War, where he played music in order to join the band, getting him off the front lines and eventually into school where he would later become an Architect.
  I speak of Merlin Barth, because he was just that, a huge individual. I looked up to him. But I was also heavily intimidated by the prospect of what I should be doing with my life because of his massive influence.
 <p>
 My mother is and was a cake designer, with her own artistic talents, whom also always said I could be something grand, like her father. 
  But, I was told by my father, a construction worker, that I had the power to be whatever I wanted, and to give forth from the spirit I had within. My father told me to become what I wanted. I never understood at the time what he meant. I thought it meant that I needed to be some amazing person in the world.
 I stayed away from the idea of being something huge. I didn't want to become another copy of my Grandfather. I meandered through ideas of writing science fiction, to becoming an Vulcanologist, all types of things, but never settling on a single idea.
   Yet, I did not have a deep desire to pursue the arts at that time, or at least, I didn't think so. Not through childhood, and not through high school. Sure, I'd taken several fun courses through ceramics, and some basic art, but I was very lost in all of my searching to become what I was to be. The Notion of becoming like my Grandfather still sat over me.  
 <p>
    Then one day, I came across a Band called the Gorillaz, and I like the idea of creating animated artworks, that I began to explore the art world. I started taking courses, dogged by a notion that there was a common thread, a thing that I could do with my life. College began to open doors of exploration. I took fine art classes, theory, and explored life drawing. Even taking classes in 3d design, and modeling. 
   It didn't last. I went through some deep hardships with family, and I was haunted by the notion that I still wasn't great enough or strong enough to make something deep, meaningful. I stopped for many years, working on family life, building a family with my Partner. Raising a child was a new kind of horizon and I focused on this as my path in life.  
 <p>
Another hardship arrived, my father passed just before the Pandemic hit, and I began to find little solace in many things, having a difficult time keeping anything but family life together.
But then, one day, it hit me, my fathers words from long ago, I could do something from within. I needed to reach towards the inside of myself and make something not just other people but to express my inner self. I began to make artworks and explore the vast world of NFT. I began to create artworks that would slowly grow from 2021 to 2022. 
 <p>
  This year my Grandfather became sick. I went to visit him and he approved of my artworks, loving all of them. Not long after that he passed as well and I began to make the Dancing stars, the pieces you are about to look at. The Orb in the middle is the orb of life and possibility. The stars are everyone, dancing around that eternal connection. It is a connection to spirit and healing. 
 <p>
It is my heart, healing from both loss and finding my own voice. A voice to told me that I never really lived in shadows.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
									<p>The question of artistic evolution. I ask that of myself every day. I utilize Pastels, large 61cm height pieces, which I transform into Jpeg. An important process for me, because while I have a physical work, it creates this digital extension that can reach across vast spaces of knowledge that the origional could not. 
    Evolution for me is two fold. The first part is to expand beyond Pastel, and beyond Charcoal artworks into a new medium. Any will do as long as I can continue to expand my understanding of what art means to me, and how I can use it to create new visual understandings. The second however, is to come to a level, with my own creative future, when I can just make those pieces, and have thom flow from my hand to anyone that can see it. Taking them from the physical realm to the digital, and then into peoples minds. Not just trapped on paper but tethered to eachother in both worlds. Digital and physical. 
Nomatter what they interpret. My evolution is to one day have those ideas easily be expressed everywhere. I want to bring awareness towards common occurances that are sadly apart of our daily world lives, that being War, Famine, Disease and Climate ignorance. 
 If I get this goal it will be amazing. I would love that. 
 I've come to understand that I might not get to that evolutionary step, but it won't mean I've failed. It'll mean I've expanded my skills as an artist beyond what they are now and in that way, my ideas will always be somewhere for you to see.</p>
