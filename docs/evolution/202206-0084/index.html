									<h3>My artistic evolution & NFT Revolution</h3>
<p>
I was raised in a place where art is not appreciated at all and close to zero art teaching in schools .

When I looked at people I would imagine lines drawing their faces tracing every detail, when I find a scene that I like I would stare so much to memorize it, I would tell myself that I have to save this rare amazing view in my brain until I can paint it one day.
Because when I try to pencil draw or paint I wasn‚Äôt good and I didn‚Äôt know how to use oil colors.

After I turned 18 I had a window of free time and more independence, and with the help of total strangers I learned painting techniques, it took me a few lessons with a surrealist artist who was a friend of mine.

When I got the knowledge and started painting I just immersed myself in the process, I lost track of time and enjoyed myself immensely.

But the result wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for, that‚Äôs not my art, I don‚Äôt have my own style.

Then Med School started and it took most of my time, I would do sketches now and then, I also had a large canvas that I was supposed to paint different structures on it to practice and I never completed it..
After 5 years I found my style! I found what I love to paint and pour my heart into, when I was sitting alone thinking while gazing at the sky above when the sun was rising.

That‚Äôs when Reverie was born, out of no where, just my imagination and I was flying with thrill ! I can never forget that feeling; The satisfaction and pleasure of seeing the picture I created in my mind on a canvas in front of me! knowing what I want and finding it.

Then I learned about NFTs through a close friend and I started my NFT journey.

Every piece is inspired by the time I spend alone, the thoughts, colors and landscapes all together with the bubbles. It‚Äôs born when contemplating things in life in that sea of thoughts flowing like bubbles in the sky.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
I will keep on pouring my heart in every piece I create and try to project the feeling of peacefulness and tranquility through them.

I‚Äôm also experimenting with digital art apps and photography, art is just so fun and soon i‚Äôll be sharing new creations.
