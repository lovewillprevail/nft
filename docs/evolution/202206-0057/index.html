									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									<p>If I had to tell my artistic story in 7 stages, it would be these:</p>
									<p>
									The first stage of my artistic development was definitely when as a child I discovered the world of cinema thanks to a VHS and movies that my brother had. As a child I did not stop dreaming about all those fantasy worlds that I saw on that television, that was when my imagination began to take flight.</p>
<p>
The second stage was when I learned to use my family's computer on my own. I remember that the first word I searched for on Google was 'life on other planets' ðŸ˜‚ I fell in love with what was possible to find on the Internet.

<p>
The third stage was when I began to discover my personal likes and hobbies. I became a fan of horror and science fiction movies and books. Specifically Lovecraft and Asimov. Now I realize that those tastes are gradually shaping what I do in my creations.

<p>
The fourth stage would be when through a friend I entered a film history class, in that class I learned about cult cinema and that there were deeper meanings in the films, that captivated me instantly, so much so that I decided to change my career from ing from software to audiovisual communication

<p>
The fifth stage was when I bought my first dsrl camera, that's when I started making my own creations. With the photos and videos that I took, I began to make montages of slightly surreal ideas that I had in my head. At that time I uploaded my content to instagram with the sole objective that my ig friends feel something when they see my work, that inspires them, that made me them happy, that what I like others also like.

<p>
The sixth and seventh stages come together and that was when I discovered that I wanted to dedicate myself to creating art forever. It was when I met someone who is now one of the most special people in my life right now, she is a plastic artist, it was my first approach to an artist, listening to her talk about her creations I felt a passion that I also felt inside of me, little by little, that desire to create things to share with others. Finally the seventh stage, was when I discovered the nft world, I was shocked to learn that it was now possible thanks to technology to create verifiable copyrights in digital art, that was the trigger that my heart told me you have to do this, you have to create, you have to inspire others just as the artists of my childhood inspired me to be what I am today. Being quite honest here, my career as a digital artist has just begun and I am still discovering the topics I want to talk about, I would like to be able to talk in the future in my pieces about more social things, about making visible communities that are ignored, about making listen to the screams of these people. So if you like my work and what I've been doing, I assure you that in the future it will be even better because I'm here to continue growing and creating until I die, so if you go with me, fasten your seat belt cause we are going to the moon ðŸš€.
									<h3>What's next</h3>
									<p>The next big stage of my evolution it's to continue exploring and learning about artificial intelligence art and also continue knowing the new and beautiful ai community. I would love to combine my abilities of profesional post producer with the tool ai, to create incredible results</p>
