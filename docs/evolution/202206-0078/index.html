									<p>1.The alien always spreading happiness, love, and positivity (this could be the short explanation under my name too)?</p>
									<p>2.Who am I? That’s a good question that I should know, but It's still a mystery but to wrap everything in a few words I am a homeless alien floating around space spreading all the good vibes filled with happiness, love, and positivity. I just want to be able to impact and motivate everyone positively, so they could receive the support they well deserve.</p>
									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									1. I believe my fascination with art and colors started early, since before I was even created. God created me extra trippy and weird, engraved it in my day, and then allowed me to be born.
									<p>
2. When I was a little kid, I had this transparent, clear plastic airplane toy. All the inside engine parts were all different colors and all that. My mom thought I was going to be an engineer or like some astronaut type thing because I would stay analyzing and playing with the plane all day.  Little did she know I didn’t care about any of that, and I was just mesmerized by the pretty colors.
									<p>
3. While in school I would always doodle all over my notebooks, folders, backpacks, desks literally anywhere I could. If I had a marker on hand or a something, I would be drawing on everything.
									<p>
4. In high school was when I was finally able to join an art class after school only lasted for a little but being in that art room with all the art supplies and equipment and just watching everyone create all sorts of different thing was just the most beautiful environment ever
									<p>
5. After that I started getting my own canvases and paint and really start creating art on my spare time and was filling my house with my paintings and give some to friends. I would also paint and draw on random household items and tables to make things more interesting.
									<p>
6. I always wanted to create art digitally and never was able to for lack of knowledge and equipment. But just recently I was able to get an iPad and a laptop and started to explore all the different avenues I could take to create art on. Clearly was overwhelmed with the potential I had in my hands, but fell in love with it even more.
									<p>
7.In the process, I discovered AI art and other programs, which is what I have currently been focusing on and learning as much as I can from it. While at the same time was looking for the next new thing I wanted to learn.

									<h3>What's next</h3>
									My main focus right now is learning everything I can about 3D art, animations, and make trippy visuals/visualizers for music videos and festivals.
