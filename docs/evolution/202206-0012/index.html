									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									<p>I really don't know if my artistic journey has had 7 states, but I'm sure it's close to that amount, even so it seems to me that it's a journey that will never have an end.
I think my first state was, watching my father draw, and me wanting to replicate what he did. I had previously experienced drawing, like every child who has that need to represent their world, but I felt closer to illustration after seeing my father.
<p>
The second state could be, all the time I spent replicating book illustrations, still as a child, but I created little.
<p>
After that I decided to make my own creations, I made several comics, with texts and stories that only a child can create.
<p>
After that, already in a pre-adolescent stage, I left drawing aside and concentrated on studying. I wanted to grow my culture and I dedicated myself to art history.
<p>
Then as a teenager, I discovered manga and I dedicated myself to replicate it, to make characters that were part of fan fictions, and try to find my own style.
<p>
After a long time without touching a pencil, nowadays, I decided to take up again what made me so happy and I found myself artistically together with a style that identifies me a lot, but even so I feel that I still have a lot to learn both technically and culturally to consider myself an artist, something that I do not feel identified with.</p>
									<h3>What's next</h3>
									<p>I consider that my next big step as an artist would be to perfect myself technically in illustration. Trying new media such as oil painting which I find very attractive.
Even so, I would like to improve in composition and the use of the color palette.
And, as I said before, it seems to me that I will never reach the state I would like to reach, because I will always want to improve myself and achieve higher states, that's why I consider this artistic journey as infinite.  </p>
