									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
									What would my life be without art? Well, it would be a journey where I couldnâ€™t express myself. I would be a rock on the bottom of the sea. I am still swimming in troubled waters, but at least Iâ€™m swimming with my authentic self and style thanks to art.
									<p>
Iâ€™ve seen how in life one can lose freedom overnight. However, through art, I am able to feel free. Yes, I am not out of my emotional prison entirely, but I can feel the fresh air of the outdoors every time I see a landscape that I captured. I feel redeemed, although I know I am not, when I look at a photo of a religious place Iâ€™ve taken. I feel that life will reward me with love sometime and therefore, I capture roses and flowers. My photography is my hopeful therapy for a happy tomorrow for me and for those around me. I also hope that people I donâ€™t know are somehow helped to feel a little better, to reflect on their stand in life, or to travel in my footsteps for a while and see life in a different way.

									<p>
Living is really understanding that everything withers, that everything eventually disappears or changes. Sometimes these changes are so drastic that the place you loved to visit is completely different than before. We are evolution. We are progress. We are time running out. We are wrinkles in the quilt of time. Therefore, photography allows me to play GOD, and for a moment, preserve a place as it was, a person as he or she looked, a riverâ€™s waters flowing free as ever, a mountain as majestic as our youth, a rose as beautiful as the grace of a woman, a sunset as impacting as a storm of light, a day in all of its glory, for all these days will never come to pass again. As a photographer, I try to capture these glory days so that they are never forgotten. We, as humans, are lucky to have many days on Earth, however, a day only has 24 hours. It is only just and prudent to make that day count and write it in the visual history book of our times. That is a photograph, a visual representation of yesterday.

									<p>
I believe that art is essential for the human condition. We are united through art. It is the bridge we walk upon to get to the core of our souls in order to better understand ourselves and others. Life shouldnâ€™t be about the words me, I, nor you. It should be about we and us. That is the main power of art. We may not be as open as we should be and therefore we fail to walk on stones of compassion and understanding for one another. Iâ€™ve failed time and time again, but art gives me hope that some day I will achieve understanding my fellow woman and man much better than I have in the past. That is why I keep making art. It is my constant search to find what unites me with people and places that sometimes seem completely different than what I am used to.

									<p>
Art sometimes puts the artist in an uncomfortable situation, but a little discomfort is OK. Art is the least of my worries at this point of my life. So, I am grateful to have art by my side when everything around me is crumbling or seems to be doing so. It is my foundation. It is my soulâ€™s microscope. It is my lantern in the darkness of the night. It is certainty in all of my doubts. It is my courage in days of fear. It is my heartâ€™s medicine. Art isnâ€™t the cure to everything, but it is the breath of freedom that encourages me to keep fighting for a better tomorrow, for me and for the people whom I cherish. I donâ€™t know if I will achieve it or how exactly it will look in the end. Endings are the hardest moments to predict, especially for a photographer who always captures the moment of the now and not of tomorrow. Like in photography, there are many angles, each with its own destiny. I donâ€™t know which destiny my camera will ultimately capture. Therefore, I live day by day, and I look outside the window of today, take out my camera, point toward the endless expanse, and let my soul drift in the creative winds of the medium, in hopes to always carry these precious moments for eternity and as I capture part of the now, move a step forward toward the unknown future that awaits.
What is next?

									<h3>What's next</h3>
I wish I knew. I also know that knowing what tomorrow would bring would not help me achieve anything. We are creatures of the now and yesterday. Tomorrow changes in the blink of an eye. Tomorrow is the land that sailors canâ€™t quite picture until it is right in front of them. I try to not make plans, for plans are futile in front of the storm of the future.
I will simply keep doing art in some shape or form, helping people if I can, and that is all that I can promise.
