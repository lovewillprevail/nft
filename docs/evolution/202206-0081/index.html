									<p>I'm Victor, an 18 years old French artist. I'm still in my studies, but I manage to get to the bottom of my passion and create a little more art every day, pushing the skills, complexity and creativity every time. I'm new to the world and the NFT community, but I've been doing 3D and special effects for a few years now. Let me introduce you to my background.</p>

									<h3>My artistic evolution</h3>
I would say that I wasn't really immersed in an art culture when I was young. My family and parents were not primarily interested in museums, movies or exhibitions. My passion for film and art-making came late in my childhood. I was creating a short film with a friend and his brother got interested in simple tricks with Adobe After Effects. That was the first time I discovered the power of video editing.
<p>
After that, I started looking for ways to recreate and learn what he had done for our short film. And that's how I started creating visual effects with After Effects.
<p>
I created my first visual effects with simple green screens and some videos from Andrew Kramer and Video Copilot. I watched tons of tutorials and learned as much as I could. And day by day, I was creating more and more special effects. It was all in 2D.
<p>
And that's when I heard about 3D with the Element 3D plug-in from Andrew's company. Unfortunately, my computer wasn't powerful enough to support it. So I invested in my first computer. And that's when the field of possibilities opened up for me.
<p>
I was creating new things every day, exploring all the software I could use and looking at all the courses and training I could find to dive into this beautiful world.
<p>
My workflow started to improve, my 3D renderings were more beautiful and the complexity of each project increased. In parallel to my studies, I was learning complex software for simulations, fabrics and everything else that is needed in the visual effects industry.
<p>
And then, a few months ago, I discovered that I could post NFTs for free on Opensea. That's how it all started, from a homemade short film to creating collections on Foundation!
<p>
									<h3>What's next</h3>

What will the future be like? To be honest, it's a blur. I want to continue to create and express my creativity through art and 3D. I would like to continue to push the learning of 3D simulation and share my creations with people. NFT will definitely be a part of my life and if I can continue to create new pieces for my collection, it will be the best reward.

I feel pretty new to the NFT community, but being able to participate in this amazing contest is very rewarding and I couldn't pass up this opportunity! I want to see what people can create and if I can add my vision of art, it will be the perfect accomplishment.
