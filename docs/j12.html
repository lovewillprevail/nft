							Ray Vanger is a Light painting photography artist addicted to waving lights in the dark.
Light painting is an art form, a combination of painting and photography, darkness is our canvas and light is the brush.
All of the artworks are pictures Light painting created in real time captured to the camera in one single photographic frame. Without Photoshop intervention (we have raw image for proof)
The artworks are done in a completely dark studio or at night in places where there is no artificial "light pollution".
<p>
Light painting is an art form a technique consists of creating Images by capturing the movement of light.
in all the creation we do the lightning by hand, We see the movement constantly changing.
We are exploring all kinds of technique some of our work highlights the abstract nature of light, we are inspired by the beauty of light in all itâ€™s various forms.
It is a technique that creates the impossible, records the paths of light in to the picture, reveals something hidden in the real world.

<p>
Light painting is a clear testimony to the beauty of the phenomenon of light. The creative potential of light brings new sensations, new colors, new meaning to our lives.
Despite the frequent use of concepts such as contemporary art, and the shadow of the technological and digital changes in photography, the emphasis in our artworks is precisely on analog, manual, low-tech aesthetics. through the use of technique from the beginning of photography to create contemporary art.

<p>
I think that this way you can reinvent the medium of photography.
My intention is to raise awareness of the existence of this type of artwork "light painting" and its inherent charm.
