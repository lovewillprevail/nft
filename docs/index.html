								An NFT Competition organized by Deeper Flows, who aims at connecting NFT Creators, Collectors and art lovers. Throughout the competition, which lasts 1 month, creators of all levels feel considered, empowered and can submit their creations during a one week timeframe.
								<p>
								<p>This event, as most "artistic" creations, is a work in progress. An ever-evolving sketch. The rules, the jury, the concept, will evolve from month to month, based on the feedback, the ideas, the mistakes and lessons learnt.

								<b>W1 and W2 : JULY 1st : Information and Request for Comments</b>
								<p>The website is updated with the new Jury list. As for June, an opportunity, for NFT Artists who wish so, to post one or several NFTs in comments of a Pinned Post [here], in order to request comments from the contest founder (@deeperflows on Twitter), who will neither participate as an artist, nor be part of the Jury team. Of course, that section is open for all artists who wish to bring their expertise to participants.</p>
								<b>W3 : July 16th : Submissions start !</b>
								<p>You submit your artwork by commenting a special Tweet of the official account with a link your NFT. ONLY ONE NFT per NFT Artist can be taken into account. If several NFTs are posted, only the first one will be taken into account, and other will be ignored.</p>
								<p>As part of their prizes, some participants to the JUNE Edition are eligible to submitting 2 artworks, provided they also invite 2 other #NFTArtists that mention them</p>
								<b>W4 : August 27th</b>
								<p>At this stage, the Jury is provided with means to perform several waves of selections through the hundreds, if not thousands+ of submissions. They will do so in a confidential manner: during the competition, no Jury member will know which piece was chosen by which other Jury member. For transparency's sake, at the very end of the competition (Week 5) that information will be disclosed, but only within the Jury team and will never be shared publicly. It is important to highlight than neither the Jury members, not the organizer of the INFTC, are allowed to submit any artwork to the competition.</p>
								<b>August 30th</b>
								<p>The organization team will gather the last vote of the jury and publish a the final result!

								<p>The Jury of the contest is made of members of the NFT Community, chosen by the organizers. Jury members do not receive any form of payment, and benefit from increased exposure through the event by being mentioned as Jury, and having a dedicated web page dedicated to their story, as a biography.</p>
								<p>They pride on being neutral, skilled and will select the artworks according to their personal feelings, with no intervention from the organizers.</p>
								<p>Feel free to discover their profiles on the <a href="jury/index.html">Jury Page</a></p>
