								<b>W1 : JUNE 1st : Information</b>
								<p>The website is revealed on June 1st, and the first week is dedicated to getting all participants up-to-speed with the rules, and create a FAQ (Frequentely Asked Questions) section based on the questions that will arise.</p>
								<p>This week is also an opportunity, for NFT Artists who wish so, to Direct Message the Twitter account of the contest, and "pre-submit" an artwork they would like to later submit to the contest, in order to request comments from the contest founder (@deeperflows on Twitter), who will neither participate as an artist, nor be part of the Jury team.</p>
								<b>W2 : June 6 - 12th : Submissions pre-selection</b>
								<p>You submit your artwork by commenting a special Tweet of the official account with a PNG / JPG / GIF of your artwork and wait for it to be validated. Pre-selections allow to filter out content that would not be suitable for a larger audience. NFT Artists can resubmit content several times, during all the duration of Week 2, if previous submissions don't go through the check. At this stage, the artworks do NOT need to wrapper as NFTs. The submission process will be a Reply to a decicated post, on Twitter.</p>
								<b>W3 : June 13th </b>
								<p>During this week, pre-selected media will need to be minted as NFT, and the URL of the NFT, posted under your original proposal. This will be when contestants are required to MINT their artwork as an NFT, on a platform of their choice (but not necessarily price it).</p>
								<b>W4 : June 20th</b>
								<p>While your submissions are prepared to be provided to the jury, each and every submission will get individually published in the @nftnftnftart Twitter channel, alors with its NFT URL, creating an opportunity for you to reach collectors. Any of the artworks that is submitted during Week 2, and that is NOT minted on an NFT website on Week 3, will not be selected as part of the works submitted to the Jury.
								<b>W5 : June 27th</b>
								<p>At this stage, the Jury is provided with means to perform several waves of selections through the hundreds, if not thousands+ of submissions. They will do so in a confidential manner: during the competition, no Jury member will know which piece was chosen by which other Jury member. For transparency's sake, at the very end of the competition (Week 5) that information will be disclosed, but only within the Jury team and will never be shared publicly. It is important to highlight than neither the Jury members, not the organizer of the INFTC, are allowed to submit any artwork to the competition.</p>
								<b>W6 : JULY 4th</b>
								<p>The organization team will gather the last vote of the jury and publish a preliminary result, awaiting confirmation that the chosen NFTs are not violating any IP rights, and let the creators fix any issues that might be related to such matters. Final results will be published on July 10th</p>
