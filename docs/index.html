								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								An NFT Competition organized by an "art lover", and where the jury is made of curated artists. That is what the INFTC is. It aims at giving a platform where creators of all levels feel considered, empowered and can submit their creations, once a month, while enjoying interactions deeper than those found on NFT Shill threads, or "You won" / "you didn't win", with their submission dilluted in hundreds or thousand+ submissions.
								<p>
								<p>This event, as my "artistic" creations, is a work in progress. An ever-evolving sketch. And will always be. The rules, the jury, the concept, will evolve from month to month, based on the feedback, the ideas, the mistakes and lessons learnt.

								<b>Week 1 : Information</b>
								<p>The website is revealed on June 1st, and the first week is dedicated to getting all participants up-to-speed with the rules, and create a FAQ (Frequentely Asked Questions) section based on the questions that will arise.</p>
								<p>This week is also an opportunity, for NFT Artists who wish so, to Direct Message the Twitter account of the contest, and "pre-submit" an artwork they would like to later submit to the contest, in order to request comments from the contest founder (@deeperflows on Twitter), who will neither participate as an artist, nor be part of the Jury team.</p>
								<b>Week 2 : Submissions pre-selection</b>
								<p>Week 2 is when #NFTArtists send their creations, for pre-selections. Pre-selections allow to filter out content that would not be suitable for a larger audience. NFT Artists can resubmit content several times, during all the duration of Week 2, if previous submissions don't go through the check. At this stage, the artworks do NOT need to wrapper as NFTs. The submission process will be a Reply to a decicated post, on Twitter.</p>
								<b>Week 3 : Publication of accepted submissions</b>
								<p>A watermarked" version of every pre-selected artworks, on the official Twitter channel of the INFTC. This will be when contestants are required to MINT their artwork as an NFT, on a platform of their choice (but not necessarily price it). The URL shall be sent back to the INFCT teamand will be associated to the "watermarked" post. After all, this is an NFT competition, not an Art Competition :-).</p>
								<b>Week 4</b>
								<p>At this stage, the Jury is provided with means to perform several waves of selections through the hundreds, if not thousands+ of submissions. They will do so in a confidential manner: during the competition, no Jury member will know which piece was chosen by which other Jury member. For transparency's sake, at the very end of the competition (Week 5) that information will be disclosed, but only within the Jury team and will never be shared publicly. It is important to highlight than neither the Jury members, not the organizer of the INFTC, are allowed to submit any artwork to the competition.</p>
								<b>Week 5</b>
								<p>The organization team will gather the last vote of the jury and publish a preliminary result, awaiting confirmation that the chosen NFTs are not violating any IP rights, and let the creators fix any issues that might be related to such matters. Final results will be published on July 10th</p>
