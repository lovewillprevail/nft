							Congratulations, you've reached this section! Thank you, friends. Can I call you friends? Oh yeah, you can't answer me. Anyway, this section isn't for conversation. It's a monologue about who I am, my art, and what inspires me. Me, me and me again. Hehehe.
							<p>
Let's get started, shall we? First of all, I'm extraordinarily gifted, a joy to be around, and remarkably insightful. Just kidding. I'm a little bit of all of these things, but in reality, I'm just a person with a camera who wants to share her vision with all of you. For me, there's no greater joy than expressing who I am and how I see the world through the prism of my art. It inspires me, and I hope it inspires you and makes you ponder. But, rather than bore you with the details and prattle on about myself, I think it's better that I allow my work to speak for me.
<p>
Yeah, I know, it's a little lazy to simply say - watch my work, and you'll get to know who I am - but, as they say, simplicity is the highest level of art and the most effective form of communication.
