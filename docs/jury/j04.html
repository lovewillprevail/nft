Architectural project manager by day and emerging artist by night. Creativity has always been part of my education and my universe. Thus, I express it through my art, with the aim of making it accessible and affordable. At home, as elsewhere, I like to create an inviting and warm atmosphere. This is why I seek that a feeling of peace, security and depth be released from my works, that they bring an influence in the places where they are found.
<p>
Rather cartesian in nature, the movement in my thoughts sometimes affects the peace of my soul. However, I have discovered that with a brush in my hand, time stands still. I am once again connected to the center of myself and touching life in a unique way. Creating becomes an act of surrender and trust. Thus, I seek to communicate a message of hope and I believe that art can bring about a transformation in everyone who looks at it and lets itself be captured.

<p>
My favorite subject is the heart, the human heart which has lived, which has been broken in the course of life, but which chooses to let itself be healed. Rejection, bereavement, illness, arguments, separation... everyone need the broken pieces of their hearts to be put back in place, their bruised hearts to be healed, for broken relationships to be restored. On my canvases, I express it like kintsugi, an ancestral Japanese art that aims to repair broken pottery with gold lacquer. The scars are then revealed rather than hidden. Through my art, I seek to express the beauty that is reborn from the ashes.
